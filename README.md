Ransomware Detector
Overview

Ransomware Detector is a Python-based program designed to identify, analyze, and mitigate ransomware threats. The program leverages network traffic analysis, threat intelligence, and security best practices to protect against and respond to ransomware activities.
Features

    In-Depth Network Analysis: Integration with Docker and Thor Lite for thorough network traffic monitoring and ransomware detection.
    Threat Intelligence: Utilization of OTXv2 for up-to-date threat data.
    Comprehensive Ransomware Handling: Identifies, alerts, and removes ransomware while protecting and restoring data.
    Security Best Practices: Implements network segmentation, access control, and user education to reduce risk.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    OTX API key (needed for threat intelligence integration)
    Python packages in requirements.txt
    Docker (optional)
